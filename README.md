# üé¢ Amusement Park Management System  

This repository contains a **system** designed to manage and optimize the operations of an amusement park. The project integrates a **robust database system** and a **dynamic web application** built using **ASP.NET Razor Pages**, ensuring scalability, advanced functionality, and user-friendly interfaces.

## üöÄ Features  

### Database System  
- **8 modules**, **18 tables** for structured and detailed data management.  
- Includes SQL scripts for database schema, triggers, views, and stored procedures:  
  - `AmusementParkDB.sql`  
  - `Procedures.sql`  
  - `Triggers.sql`  
  - `Views.sql`  
- Covers key functionalities:  
  - **User Management** (accounts, agreements, and access control).  
  - **Attractions and Events** (detailed categorization and planning).  
  - **Tickets and Reservations** (sales and customer experience optimization).  
  - **Promotions and Coupons** (discounts and marketing strategies).  

### Web Application  
- Built using **ASP.NET Razor Pages** with a modular and maintainable structure.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, and delete records for every database table.  
- **Table Display**:  
  - Displays full data from at least two tables (`Users`, `Orders`) on separate pages.  
- **Custom Buttons**:  
  - Delete all records from a selected table with a single click.  
  - Anonymize column data (e.g., replacing names in the `Users` table with generic values like `User-1`).  
- **Filtering and Sorting**:  
  - Implemented for the `Users` table.  
  - Filter by `Surname`, sort by `ID`, `Name`, or `Surname`.  
- **Master-Slave Relationship**:  
  - Selecting an order in the `Orders` table dynamically loads its associated items in the `OrderItems` table.
